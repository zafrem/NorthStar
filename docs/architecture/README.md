# NorthStar Architecture

## Overview

NorthStar is an MCP server that provides organizational goal context to AI assistants. It enables:

- **Goal Hierarchy**: Define company, department, and team-level goals with key results
- **AI Guidelines**: Specify guidelines at each organizational level that inform AI recommendations
- **Cross-Team Visibility**: Search and explore goals from collaborator teams
- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensure individual contributions align with organizational objectives
