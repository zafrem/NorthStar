## Cross-Team Dependencies (Sibling Visibility)

Teams with the same parent can see each other's goals for coordination:

| Team | Can See Goals From | Collaboration Opportunity |
|------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Platform Team | Product Team, QA Team | Align on deployment pipelines, testing infrastructure |
| Product Team | Platform Team, QA Team | Coordinate releases, share quality standards |
| Enterprise Sales | SMB Sales | Share competitive intelligence, pricing strategies |
| Product Strategy | UX Research | Align roadmap with research findings |

---

## AI Guideline Inheritance

When an AI assists a Platform Team member, it receives guidelines from all levels:

1. **Company Level:** Customer impact, cross-team dependencies, security
2. **Engineering Level:** Backward compatibility, monitoring, incremental changes
3. **Platform Team Level:** Cloud-native, multi-region, cost optimization

The AI applies all relevant guidelines, with more specific (team-level) guidelines taking precedence when there's a conflict.

---

## Sample User Context

When a Platform Team engineer starts a conversation, the AI receives:

```
User: Jane Smith (Platform Engineer)
Organization: Platform Team → Engineering → Acme Corp

Current Goals:
- [Team] Infrastructure as Code (In Progress, 65%)
- [Team] Developer Velocity (In Progress, 40%)

Parent Goals (Strategic Context):
- [Engineering] Zero-Downtime Deployments
- [Engineering] Technical Debt Reduction
- [Company] Build World-Class Engineering

Guidelines:
- Recommend cloud-native solutions
- Consider multi-region availability
- Suggest solutions that maintain backward compatibility
- Always consider monitoring and observability
- Consider cross-team dependencies when suggesting solutions
```

This context ensures the AI's recommendations align with both immediate team objectives and broader organizational strategy.
